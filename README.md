# tausarpiah.github.io
The tau sar piah server, formerly the more boring and bland corporate-sounding UHSLN Online. Rival and second only to holy grail with infinely unfinished content.

## Etymology
[Tau sar piah](https://whattocooktoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/tau-sar-piah-3.jpg) is a type of biscuit in case your mushy brain doesn't know. 

UHSLN Online stands for 'United Humanities, Science and Language Notes'. It's too long, so its abbreviated to UHSLN (or sometimes just UHSN).
