    <h1>Case study of British Colonial Rule in Malaya (1870s-1920s)</h1>
    <h2>British intervention in Malaya</h2>
    <h3>Early intervention problems</h3>
    <p>
        1. <strong>The early British Residents in the Malay States had no system to follow and no clear rules to guide them.</strong>  This experiment of British 'advice' depended partly on how much the advice was wanted by the Malay authorities and partly on how strongly the Resident was likely to be supported by the Straits Settlements govt.  
    </p>
    <p>
        2. <strong>Under the terms of the Pangkor engagement the Resident was entitled, strictly speaking to advise on very little.</strong>  Questions touching Malay religion and custom were not included among those on which his advice was to be sought and acted upon.  There was some possibility of separating purely religious matters from Malay politics, but custom ran through everything.  How were the revenues and the general administration of the state to be regulated under the advice of the Resident without touching, matters of custom ? The revenues were, by custom, the personal incomes of the Sultan and his chiefs, there were also all kinds of customary claims, through family descent, to the offices of state.  
    </p> 
    <p>
        3. Even in the case of a Sultan willing to take' advice, there remained the <strong>practical difficulty of how to carry out any changes.</strong>  The governments of the Malay states at this time were not centralised and there was no civil service.  The early Resident on taking up his appointment stood very much on his own. If his advice was to be put into practice, he was the one who had to do it.  The Resident, it would seem, had the choice of either doing nothing much or of giving advice and acting upon it himself In the latter case, he inevitably became a government executive and not just an adviser. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The position of the early British Resident would have been delicate and difficult enough even if the Malay states had been in a stable condition when he took up his appointment, but this, of course, was far from being the case.  <strong>It was the civil wars among the Malays and Chinese which had provided the opportunity for British intervention and many problems of law and order were still outstanding</strong> in the three states to which British Residents were first sent The Resident had no strong military force with which he could handle a violent situation.

    <h3>Problems of the Residential System</h3>
    <h4>1. Little help from Britain</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>No clear boundaries and rules</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>2. Relation issues & power disputes</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Different intepretations by Malay rulers v.s. Resident</li>
        <li>Malay govt. resented the British interference</li>
        <li>Role unclear (see point 1)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>3. Very limited power</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>No civil service &ndash; had to start everything from scratch</li>
        <li>No revenue &ndash; cannot build efficient civil service</li>
        <li>Very small army, no police force &ndash; cannot enforce order</li>
        <li>One-man job &ndash; very difficult to do anything</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>4. Resistant Sultan & followers</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>British: thought they could just deal with the Sultan, who would pass down the orders</li>
        <li>Chiefs: independent, could ignore or resist Sultan & Resident. Didn't help that the chiefs disliked British orders.</li>
        <li>Not willing to change tradition</li>
        <li>Saw British as interfering (see point 2)</li>
    </ul>
