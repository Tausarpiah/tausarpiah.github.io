            <h2>Assets</h2>
            <q>How much do I have?</q>
            <p>Assets are anything valuable that a company owns, whether it's land, equipment, buildings or 'intellectual property'.</p>
            <p>So long something has <u>value</u> and is <u>owned by you</u>, it is an asset.</p>
            <h4>Common asset types</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Accounts recievable</b>: Payments that clients and customers owe</li>
                <li><b>Cash</b>: Money in the bank account.</li>
                <li><b>Property and Equipment (P&E)</b>: buildings/tools needed for operation.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Classification of assets:</h4>
            Assets are generally divided into two catergories:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Current assets</b>: Cash, and anything that can be relatively converted into cash.</li>
                <li><b>Fixed assets</b>: Land, trade-marks, and the intangible 'value' of a brand.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="liabilities">
            <h2>Liabilities</h2>
            <q>How much do I owe?</q>
            <p><strong>Liabilities</strong> are any debts your company has or owes.</p>
            <p>If someone has promised to pay someone in the future, and hasn't paid them yet, that’s a liability.</p>
            <h4>Common liabilities</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Accounts payable</b>: payments owed to suppliers.</li>
                <li><b>Bank loans</b>: <u>principal</u> owed to <u>investors</u> (in this case, the bank is the investor).</li>
                <li><b>Salaries & wages payable</b>: Wages and wages to be paid later.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Classification of liabilities</h4>
            There are two main kinds of liabilities:
            <ol>
                <li><b>Current</b>: debts within 1 year/12 months</li>
                <li><b>Non-current / Future</b>: debts ranging beyond 1 year/12 months.</li>
            </ol>

        <section id="equity">
            <h2>Equities</h2>
            <q>How much is left over?</q>
            <p><strong>Equity</strong> is how much value is left over once you’ve totalled up everything valuable that you have, and subtracted everything you owe to your creditors.</p>
            <p>For many smaller owners, equity is the essential net worth of their business.</p>
            <h3>Equity equation</h3>
            <strong>Assets - Liabilities = <u>Equity</u></strong>
            <h4>Types of equity</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>For <b>sole proprietorship</b>, equity is usually <u>owner's equity</u>.</li>
                <li>For <b>corporations</b> (i.e. public liability companies), it is called <u>shareholder's equity</u>.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="equation">
            <h2>Equity equation</h2>
            <p>This whole thing can be summed up by:</p>
            <span class="impt">
                Assets - Liabilities = Equities
            </span>
